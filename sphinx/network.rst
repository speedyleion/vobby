Network Communication
=====================

|this_program| is targeted at IDE interfaces that can communicate via network
sockets.

To facilitate this communication `Twisted <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/>`_ is
used.  The hope is that using twisted it will make it easy to add future IDE
interfaces.  With the power of Twisted comes some complexity.  The following are
some suggested reading to help get a basic understanding of Twisted:

- Dave Peticolas' excellent tutorial

- Twisted official developer guides
